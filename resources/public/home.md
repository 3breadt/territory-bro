Territory Bro is a tool for managing territory cards in the congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses.

* [Print new territory cards](#2-print-and-cut) with up-to-date street maps
* Store do-not-calls
* Share links to a territory, so that the publisher can see only that territory and its
  do-not-calls ([example link](/share/5jsrmZQ3zgE/123))

<div class="sms-discussion" aria-description="Example SMS discussion">
<p class="sms-message incoming">May I get a new territory?</p>
<p class="sms-message outgoing">Sure. Here you go: <a href="/share/5jsrmZQ3zgE/123">https://territorybro.com<wbr>/share<wbr>/5jsrmZQ3zgE<wbr>/123</a></p>
<p class="sms-message incoming">Thanks!</p>
</div>

Someday in the future, Territory Bro will also keep track of assigned and returned territories, and produce statistics
of covered territories.

## Example: Creating New Territory Cards

### 1. Draw the Territories on a Map

This is done using the free [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) application and saved into a database. Multiple people can
edit the same database online, so the work of drawing the territories can be delegated easily.

If you have already drawn the territories as polygons or lines with a map editor (e.g. Google Maps or Google Earth),
it's possible to copy the geographic data from there and save many hours of work.

### 2. Print and Cut

Territory Bro will print the territory cards along with their metadata (e.g. territory number, addresses). The QR code
can be scanned to see the same territory and also its do-not-calls. There is also a minimap which shows where the
territory is located within the city.

Print it on thick paper, cut with a sharp knife and ruler along the crop marks, and you're done!
