# Drawing Regions on Map

TODO: video

Draw the borders of your congregation by adding a feature to the *region* layer. For the congregation boundaries you should select the *congregation* checkbox. To show all of the congregation area in the territory card minimap (top left corner), also select the *minimap_viewport* checkbox for the same feature. Otherwise draw one or more new features just for the minimap viewport. To split the congregation area into multiple named sub regions, you may create features with the *subregion* checkbox selected.
