## Translation notes

*Territory* is what you'd expect. Use the established word in your language for it.

*Region* is an area which is much bigger than a territory. It could be a suburb or even a whole city. The translations
should use different words for *territory* and *region* consistently.

The texts of `TerritoryCard.title` and `TerritoryCard.footer` have been taken directly from the old territory card
templates that you get from Bethel.

Use the established words in your language for terms like *congregation*, *territory card*, *do-not-calls*, *publisher*, *territory servant* etc.
