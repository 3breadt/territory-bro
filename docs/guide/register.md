# Registering an Account

Visit <https://beta.territorybro.com/register> and login using your Google or Facebook account.

Territory Bro is currently in early access, so you will need to complete the registration by email. Follow the instructions on the registration page.

It is recommended to [subscribe to the announcements mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/territory-bro-announcements/join) to be notified about important updates to Territory Bro.

After your registration is complete, you can download the QGIS project file for your congregation at <https://beta.territorybro.com>. Install the [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) map editor to be able to open that project file.

[The rest of this user guide](/guide) will explain that how to use QGIS to add your territories to the map.
