The territory cards will show up properly only with the latest [Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) when the *Experimental Web Platform features* flag is enabled on the `chrome://flags` configuration page.

Print the territory cards page as PDF. Then open the PDF in [Adobe Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/), print one path with 100% scale on A4 paper and measure the distance between the printed crop marks. Then measure that what the dimensions of the card should really be, so that it would fit inside your protective plastic cases. Calculate the correct scale for printing the cards by dividing those two measures (it's probably about 92%).

Print the territory cards with the correct scale on thick A4 paper. Cut the cards along the crop marks using a ruler and a sharp knife. Optionally cover the cards with adhesive book covering film (before cutting them out).
