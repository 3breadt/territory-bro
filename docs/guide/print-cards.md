Using the latest Chrome or Firefox, save the territory cards page as PDF. Open the PDF in [Adobe Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/), print one page with 100% scale on A4 paper and measure the distance between the printed crop marks. Then measure that what the dimensions of the card should really be, so that it would fit inside your protective plastic cases. Calculate the correct scale for printing the cards by dividing those two measures (last time I did it, it was about 92%).

Print the territory cards with the correct scale on thick A4 paper. Cut the cards along the crop marks using a ruler and a sharp knife. Optionally cover the cards with adhesive book covering film (before cutting them out).
